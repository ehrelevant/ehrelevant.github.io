# Personal Website

Welcome to my the repository for my personal website! It contains information on me, my skill set and some of my past projects which I am very proud of. You can access it by clicking [here](https://ehrelevant.github.io/)!

## Assets

This website uses several assets from external sources, notably including the logos of various companies and products. Some logos were retreived from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/), including all logos related to social media websites (Github, X, LinkedIn, etc.). Most logos were retrieved from [TechIcons](https://techicons.dev/), and they themselves sourced their icons from [devicon](https://devicon.dev/) by [Konpa](https://github.com/konpa) and the many other contributors of [devicon](https://github.com/konpa).

I'm planning on adding a list of attributions for certain logos in the future. For now, note that most logos will link to the website (if any) of the appropriate creators of said logo if possible.
